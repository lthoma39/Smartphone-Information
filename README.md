## Project Description
Design and code an Android app that displays information about smart phones. The appâ€™s main activity
displays a list whose items contain information about a particular brand of smart phone. This information
includes a thumbnail picture of a phone, and two text strings with different size fonts. The thumbnail
picture is shown on the left of a list item; the two text strings are shown on top of each other to the right
of the thumbnail. The first (top) text string uses a larger font than the second text string; this text string
displays the brand and model of a smart phone (e.g., iPhone XS Max, Samsung Galaxy S9, etc.) The second
(bottom) text string contains the screen size and price range of that smart phone (e.g., 6.5 inch display,
a small fortune). Feel free to choose your images from pictures publicly-available (and not copyrighted
or otherwise protected) on the Internet. Also, feel free to choose how to fit the pictures into thumbnails
appearing in your list (e.g. whether to scale the picture or not, etc.) You should include at least 6 items in
the list and ensure that the list is scrollable. (The list should not fit in the display of the Pixel device; at least
one item should be completely off-screen due to screen size.)
